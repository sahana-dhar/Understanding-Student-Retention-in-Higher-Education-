    "1. (2\\%) Describes and motivates a real-world problem where data science may provide helpful insights. This problem must consist of at least two key questions of interest and your description of the problem and questions should be easily understood by a casual reader. Citations to motivating sources are preferred where possible (e.g. news articles, published papers, etc. Do not use Wikipedia itself, but the links Wikipedia articles cite may be useful)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. (2\\%) Characterize the source(s) of your dataset by either:\n",
    "* Explicitly loading and showing a dataset's contents\n",
    "* Describing a data source(s) for your project (include links if applicable, or explain how the data will be collected)\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, describe the contents, reliability, and issues you expect to encounter in collecting these data. Describe, in brief, how you intend to clean the dataset to prepare it for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **note**: Datasets must be sufficiently technically challenging to collect/clean for full credit to be assigned. It is *not* sufficient to download one Kaggle csv for your data collection.\n",
    "3. (1\\%) Write one or two sentences about how the data will be used to solve the problem and your two questions of interest. At this point of the semester, we haven't studied the machine learning methods yet, but you should have a general idea of what you can do with ML. If you do not, ask a TA or the professor or do a little googling."

    "# Understanding Freshman Satisfaction and Retention in Higher Education\n",
    "## Sahana Dhar\n",
    "\n",
    "College and university life for students is an importance experience for many young adults nowadays. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 61.8% of high school graduates were enrolled in college (2021). A significant issue that many institutions face is their impact on freshman satsifaction and the return rate of first year students. Colleges and unversities must continue adapting to the needs and expectations of the student bodies, in order to mintain enrollment rates. The questions I will be exploring in this projects are as follows:\n",
    "1) What are the key determinants of freshman satisfaction within colleges, and how do they differ against institutions.\n",
    "2) How do various institutional factors, such as tuition costs, diversity, academic calendar systems, on-campus housing availability, the number of undergraduates, and whether an institution is public or private, impact the likelihood of freshmen returning for their sophomore year?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions will include analyzing aspects of college life, such as the environment, diversity, facilities, and the student body, which ultimately impacts any students enjoyment of their college experience and their decision to continue their education there.\n"

To prepare the dataset for the most efficient analysis, I will input or remove missing values or rows as necessary, and convert any numerical data into a float to run mathematical operations, such as correlations or regressions.
